# asm3_docker

This repository contains Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml implementation of Animal Shelter Manager 3 (https://sheltermanager.com/site/en_home.html).

Unfortunately the redirecting of the URLs are not working and is the last stumbling block of getting the whole docker stack to work correctly.

## 🚀 Features

- ASM3 v49
- Postgres 16

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git](https://github.com/jon-donker/asm3_docker.git)
cd asm3_docker
docker compose up -d
```

Navigate to http://localhost/asm3
